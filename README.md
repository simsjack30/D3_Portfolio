# D3 Portfolio Site

This site was built as a demonstration of complex data visualization for web-based applications using D3, the Layer Cake framework, and LayerChart. The site is built using Svelte, SvelteKit, and Svelte-UX. The application features three different charts, each displaying a significantly different dataset and visualization method:

- **United States Choropleth**: Sources information from census data.
- **Map with Static Tile API Calls**: Displays satellite imagery.
- **Historic Stock Graphic**: Sources information from financial price history.

You can visit the live site [here](https://data-portfolio-two.vercel.app/)!
